# Movie Catalog Explorer APP

Challenge developed by Nuno Azevedo.
Any questions or changes that are necessary, please let me know and I will develop them. I'm very interested in this project and I'm open to doing any tests that are necessary.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Not yet implemented, it was not described that I had to do tests but I can do it if necessary on the same day.
